# fsPDA
This repo hosts the companion function for 
Zhentao Shi and Jingyi Huang (2019): "[Forward-Selected Panel Data Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05894)" arXiv: 1908.05894

The key function is provided, while this repo is under construction for documentation. We aim to develop it into an R package.

Under the root folder:
* **test.R** is an R script that replicates the empirical example in the paper about China's luxury watch import.
* **fsPDA.R** contains a documented function *fsPDA*. It reports the identity of the selected units, the treatment effects over time, and the t-statistic for the average treatment effect.

Any comments are welcome.
