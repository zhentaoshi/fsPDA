This repo hosts the companion function for 
Zhentao Shi and Jingyi Huang (2019): "[Forward-Selected Panel Data Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05894)" arXiv: 1908.05894

The key function is provided, but this repo is under construction for documentation. We aim to develop it into an R package.

The test script replicates the second example in the paper about luxury watch import.
